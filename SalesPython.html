									<h1> Sales Analysis <br />
                                         using Python</h1>
									<p>In this project, we utilise the power of <b>Pandas</b> a python library that is widely used for data wrangling and data manipulation in order to perform sales analysis on sales data for the year 2019.<br />

                                        After cleaning and sorting the data, the data was plotted using <b>Matplotlib</b>, a python library for data visualization, in order to determine the best month for sales and identifying which city sold the most product.
                                        </p>

                                        Also, the suitable time to display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product was visualized.
